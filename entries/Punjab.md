Punjab is a region in South Asia, located partly in Pakistan and partly in India. It is one of the most historic and culturally rich regions in the subcontinent. The name "Punjab" is derived from the Persian words "Panj" meaning "five" and "Aab" meaning "waters," signifying the five rivers that flow through the region.

Punjab is situated in the northwestern part of the Indian subcontinent, bordered by the Indian states of Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Rajasthan, and the Pakistani provinces of Sindh, Balochistan, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The region is primarily flat with fertile plains, making it an agriculturally productive area. The five rivers that traverse Punjab are the Beas, Chenab, Jhelum, Ravi, and Sutlej.

The climate in Punjab is characterized by hot summers and cold winters. The summer temperatures can reach up to 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit), while winter temperatures can drop below freezing.
